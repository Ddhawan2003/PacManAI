# AI-Powered Pac-Man Agent üïπÔ∏èü§ñ

## Overview
This project implements an **AI-powered Pac-Man agent** using various **search algorithms, reinforcement learning, and decision-making strategies** to navigate and optimize gameplay in the Pac-Man environment. The agent is designed to intelligently plan its moves, avoid ghosts, and maximize score.

## Features
- **Search Algorithms:** Implemented **BFS, DFS, A*, and UCS** for optimal pathfinding.
- **Adversarial Search:** Developed **Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning** for competitive decision-making.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Trained an **RL-based Pac-Man agent** using **Q-Learning** to adapt to dynamic game conditions.
- **Heuristic Evaluation:** Optimized agent performance with heuristic-based strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python üêç
- **AI Concepts:** Search algorithms, adversarial search, reinforcement learning
- **Libraries & Tools:** NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization), Berkeley AI Pac-Man framework
